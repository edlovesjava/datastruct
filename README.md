# datastruct
This is a repository for me to learn and practice data structures and algorithms in python.

I am pretty new to python (or at least new to actually LEARNING python rather than just getting by)

And it's been over 30 years since I took a data structures class in college.  
So I am going to start with the basics and work my way up to more complex 
data structures and algorithms.
